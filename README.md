# GifTastic

This project encompasses pulling 10 gifs via the GiPHY API for each of the buttons created on the page.

The user can add a button with their favorite travel place by simply inputting the name of the place in the search box and clicking submit.

This page is for anyone looking to see what kind interesting photos have been taken or are associated with their travel place of choice.
